create a special controller action to fetch the 25 most recently updated
notes.

on the start page, send two requests:
* one for the notebooks index
* one for the 25 most recent notes
I might use pagination to keep  rendering more notes until all of them
are fetched.

dont render the notebooks until the user explicitly wants them.
refactor the css so that all of the elements are att width and height
100% leading up to my sidebar and my main view
* then I dont have to make my sidebar position fixed

gotta find an alternative to horizontal rules in my sidebar
