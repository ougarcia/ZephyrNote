gotta fix the thing where my things are added in the wrong order

i think i can dry up my templates, too.

if i have time I'll fix the thing where if the screen gets too narrow my
navbar goes under my sidebar


redo the whole new note thing. make it so you don't need the notebook
for a new note. might be impossible. 

add the tags in the note index item view
